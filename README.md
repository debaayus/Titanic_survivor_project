# Titanic_survivor_project

Attempted the starter Kaggle project with various implementations with two promising results:
1. Ensemble classififer with soft voting
2. Multi Layer Perecptron Classifier (large variance)

I perfomed a lot of feature engineering for favourable results which included:
1. Creating a new feature - family size.
2. Converted few categories to one-hot-encoders.
3. Used correlation tables to weed out certain features.
4. Data imputation
